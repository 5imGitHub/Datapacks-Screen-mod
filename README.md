## Datapacks Screen mod
A simple mod that adds a hotkey to open datapacks selection screen that allows you to toggle and reorder datapacks. This is client-side mod and only works on integrated servers where the player is host.

Also you can toggle auto-reload for enabled datapacks. This feature automatically reloads all chanded .mcfunction files and function tags in selected datapacks.

## TODO
Add autoreloading for other datapack elements:
- advancements
- recipes
- non function tags
- predicates
- loot tables
